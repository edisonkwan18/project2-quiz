## Languages

During the development phase, we leveraged a comprehensive stack of technologies to ensure a robust and efficient web application. **HTML** served as the backbone for structuring the content and layout of our web pages, allowing us to define elements and organize information effectively.

## Solved Bugs

### Landing page image silde responsive problem

- To make the images float to left. I need to calculate to exactly width of the image then the next image can push the current image to the left.
- I have the problem on responsive because I need make width change during responsive
- I use ```calc(0 * 100vw)``` and it works


``` @keyframes move { ```

```  0% {transform: translate(calc(0 * 100vw));} ```

```  25% {transform: translate(calc(-1 * 100vw));} ```

```  50% {transform: translate(calc(-2 * 100vw));} ```

```  75% {transform: translate(calc(-3 * 100vw));} ```

```  100% {transform: translate(calc(-4 * 100vw));} ```

``` } ```

/* The setting of the image */

``` .item {  ```

``` 	width: 100vw;  ```

``` 	min-width: var(--min-width);  ```

``` 	float: left;  ```

``` }  ```

``` .item > img { ```

``` aspect-ratio: 1 / 1; ```

``` object-fit: fill; ```

``` 	object-position: center; ```

``` } ```

- Github will give me an alert to create a pull request.
